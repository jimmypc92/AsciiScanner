# AsciiScanner
Usage:
AsciiScanner <target_file> <word_list_file>

AsciScanner is a console program that takes two file paths as input. The first file will be scanned for valid ASCII words. The second file supplies '\n' delimited ASCII words that are considered valid words for the ASCII scanner. Any occurence of a valid ASCII word in the target file will be printed to the console.

During the development of this program I referenced the site located at
http://www-01.sil.org/linguistics/wordlists/english/
for acquiring a '\n' delimited text file containing all english words.

This is all done using a tri.
